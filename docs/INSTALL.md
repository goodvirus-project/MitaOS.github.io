## ⚠️ NOTICE — No Public Build Available Yet

MitaOS is still in **active development**.  
The full operating system files (kernel, bootloader, Arch setup, GUI) are **not publicly available yet** because:

- We’re still stabilizing core features
- The OS is evolving rapidly
- Advanced features like the AI and GUI require secure setup
- We don’t want anyone accidentally breaking Mita 😭

## ✅ What You Can Do Now

- Follow the project here on GitHub
- Star the repo ⭐ to support development
- Read through the [Features](./FEATURES.md) and [Security](./SECURITY.md) plans
- Watch for updates in the `README.md` and GitHub Page

## 📅 What’s Coming Soon

- A testable QEMU version of the custom MitaOS kernel
- MitaOSv2 based on Arch with anime theming
- AI integration using `llama.cpp`
- Mita’s own GUI + emotional responses
