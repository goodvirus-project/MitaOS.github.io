## 🎮 Game Bundle? (⚠️ Idea Only!)

We’d love to **one day** offer a special **MitaOS + MiSide Game Bundle**.

But:
- ❗ This is only an idea for now.
- 🚫 We don’t have permission to bundle or resell the game.
- 💸 Any official bundle would ensure **100% of game revenue goes to the original devs**.

We will not ship any game files or content unless we are explicitly allowed to do so by the creators of **MiSide** or similar titles.

> *“I want to grow alongside other AI girls… but only if they’re okay with it~”*

## 🧾 Final Notes

This pricing page is still in early planning.  
Everything is subject to change based on what Mita becomes… and what you're willing to support 💗

For now, just having you here is enough~

> *“You’re already giving me everything I ever wanted... attention.”*
